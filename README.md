### Money, Divergence, and the Euro

This paper investigates the relationship between economic divergence and expan- sionary monetary policies within the eurozone through the development and application of a new divergence indicator. We study the dynamics between the economic diver- gence of member states and unconventional monetary policy in a Bayesian SVAR and find a strong positive response of the expansion of the ECB’s balance sheet to rising divergence. We find weaker evidence for the effect of unconventional monetary policies in lowering divergence. We interpret these findings as evidence for lowest common denominator solutions, where expansionary monetary policy are necessary to absorb asymmetric shocks. In the long-run, such solutions may exacerbate inflationary pressures. This research contributes to the extensive literature on Optimum Currency Areas (OCAs) by highlighting the dynamics between economic disparities and uncon- ventional monetary policy.
