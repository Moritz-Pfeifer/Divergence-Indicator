This paper investigates the relationship between expansionary monetary policies and economic divergence within the eurozone through the development and application of a new divergence indicator. Our analysis reveals that the European Central Bankâ€™s (ECB) expansionary policies, while aimed at stabilizing the region, inadvertently contribute to a cycle of in-creasing divergence among member states, a dynamic that may exacerbate inflationary pressures across the eurozone. We study this dynamic with Bayesian methods and find a strong positive non-linear relationship be-tween increasing divergence in the euro area and the balance-sheet based monetary policy of the ECB. This research contributes to the extensive lit-erature on Optimal Currency Areas (OCAs) by highlighting the dynamics between monetary policy measures and economic disparities.![image](https://github.com/Moritz-Pfeifer/Divergence-Indicator/assets/53644596/0054268e-d936-46ee-91a7-7d7a3ec7ec3a)
