### The Euro, Divergence, and Inflation

This paper investigates the relationship between expansionary monetary policies and economic divergence within the eurozone through the development and application of a new divergence indicator. Our analysis reveals that the European Central Bank’s (ECB) expansionary policies, while aimed at stabilizing the region, inadvertently contribute to a cycle of in-creasing divergence among member states, a dynamic that may exacerbate inflationary pressures across the eurozone. We study this dynamic with Bayesian methods and find a strong positive non-linear relationship be-tween increasing divergence in the euro area and the balance-sheet based monetary policy of the ECB. This research contributes to the extensive literature on Optimal Currency Areas (OCAs) by highlighting the dynamics between monetary policy measures and economic disparities.
