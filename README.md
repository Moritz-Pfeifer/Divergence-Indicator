### Monetary Policy, Divergence, and the Euro

This paper investigates the relationship between economic divergence and expansionary monetary policies within the eurozone based on a new divergence indicator. We study the dynamics between the economic divergence of member states and unconventional monetary policy in a Bayesian SVAR and find a strong positive response of the expansion of the ECB's balance sheet to rising divergence. We find weaker evidence for unconventional monetary policies lowering divergence. We interpret these findings as evidence that expansionary monetary policy aims to absorb shocks leading to divergence but may exacerbate divergence and inflationary pressures in the long-run. This research contributes to the literature on Optimum Currency Areas (OCAs) by highlighting the dynamics between economic disparities and unconventional monetary policy.
