### The Euro, Divergence, and Inflation

This paper investigates the relationship between expansionary monetary policies and economic divergence within the eurozone through the development and application of a new divergence indicator. Our analysis reveals that the European Central Bank’s (ECB) expansionary policies, while aimed at stabilizing the region, inadvertently contribute to a cycle of increasing divergence among member states, a dynamic that may exacerbate inflationary pressures across the eurozone. We study this dynamic with Bayesian methods and find a strong positive non-linear relationship between increasing divergence in the euro area and the balance-sheet based monetary policy of the ECB. This research contributes to the extensive literature on Optimal Currency Areas (OCAs) by highlighting the dynamics between monetary policy measures and economic disparities.

The indicator measures the standard deviation of inflation rates (HICP), wage growth, GDP per capita, real growth rates and debt levels as a percentage of the GDP of all euro area countries. We also measure the standard deviation of real price level-based exchange rates and trade deficits against Germany. Values are continuous from the point of accession, i.e., euro adoption for countries joining the euro area post-1999, starting from the initial membership of 11 countries. We scale the standard deviations of the individual indicators between 1 and 0, where the lowest observed divergence is marked by 0 and the highest observed divergence is marked by 1. We then calculate an unweighted average value for each quarter from 1999Q1-2023Q4, i.e. for 25 years. The resulting indicator (Fig. below) points clearly upwards, indicating growing heterogeneity in the eurozone. With an average of around 0,3, the indicator started to grow faster in 2016 and peaked in October 2023 at 0,7.
